## info
This project is a weather dashboard app with search functionality to find current weather conditions and forecasted weather for multiple cities. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve data for the cities, AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve the data in JSON format, dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and displays a search history which the user can click to access past cities searched via local storage.
